      "\"The Wizard of Oz\" is a classic 1939 American musical fantasy film based on L. Frank Baum's 1900 children's novel \"The Wonderful Wizard of Oz.\" The story follows a young girl named Dorothy Gale, who lives on a farm in Kansas with her Aunt Em and Uncle Henry. A tornado sweeps her away to the magical land of Oz, where she accidentally lands her house on the Wicked Witch of the East, killing her.\n",
      "\n",
      "In Oz, Dorothy meets Glinda, the Good Witch of the North, who advises her to follow the Yellow Brick Road to the Emerald City to seek the help of the Wizard of Oz to return home. Along the way, Dorothy befriends the Scarecrow, who desires a brain; the Tin Man, who longs for a heart; and the Cowardly Lion, who seeks courage. Together, they embark on a journey filled with challenges and encounters with the Wicked Witch of the West, who seeks revenge for her sister's death.\n",
      "\n",
      "Upon reaching the Emerald City, the Wizard agrees to grant their wishes if they bring him the Wicked Witch's broomstick. After a series of trials, they succeed, only to discover that the Wizard is actually a kind-hearted but ordinary man using illusions to appear powerful. He helps the Scarecrow, Tin Man, and Lion realize they already possess the qualities they seek. To help Dorothy, Glinda reveals that she can return home by clicking her ruby slippers together and repeating, \"There's no place like home.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "Dorothy awakens back in Kansas, realizing her adventures in Oz were a dream, but the experience leaves her with newfound appreciation for her family and home. The film is celebrated for its iconic performances, memorable songs like \"Over the Rainbow,\" and its timeless themes of friendship, courage, and self-discovery.\n",

      "### Explanation of Voltage Drop and Ohm's Law\n",
      "\n",
      "**Voltage Drop:**\n",
      "Voltage drop refers to the reduction in voltage as electric current flows through a component or conductor in a circuit. It occurs because electrical components and conductors have inherent resistance, which impedes the flow of electric current. As current flows through a resistor or any other component with resistance, energy is lost in the form of heat, causing a decrease in voltage across that component.\n",
      "\n",
      "**Why Voltage Drop Occurs:**\n",
      "Voltage drop occurs due to the resistance in the circuit. According to Ohm's Law, when current flows through a resistor, the potential energy (voltage) is used up to overcome the resistance, resulting in a drop in voltage.\n",
      "\n",
      "**Ohm’s Law:**\n",
      "Ohm's Law is a fundamental principle in electronics and electrical engineering that describes the relationship between voltage (V), current (I), and resistance (R) in a circuit. It is mathematically expressed as:\n",
      "\n",
      "\\[ V = I \\times R \\]\n",
      "\n",
      "Where:\n",
      "- \\( V \\) is the voltage across the component (in volts),\n",
      "- \\( I \\) is the current flowing through the component (in amperes),\n",
      "- \\( R \\) is the resistance of the component (in ohms).\n",
      "\n",
      "### Required Inputs for the Voltage Drop Function\n",
      "\n",
      "To calculate the voltage drop across a resistor using Ohm's Law, the required inputs are:\n",
      "- **Current (I):** The amount of electric current flowing through the resistor, measured in amperes (A).\n",
      "- **Resistance (R):** The resistance of the resistor, measured in ohms (Ω).\n",
      "\n",
      "### What the Function Should Return\n",
      "\n",
      "The function should return the voltage drop across the resistor, calculated using Ohm's Law.\n",
      "\n",
      "### Python Function to Calculate Voltage Drop\n",
      "\n",
      "Here's the Python function named `voltage_drop` that takes current and resistance as inputs and returns the voltage drop:\n",
      "\n",
      "```python\n",
      "def voltage_drop(current, resistance):\n",
      "    \"\"\"\n",
      "    Calculate the voltage drop across a resistor.\n",
      "\n",
      "    :param current: Current in amperes (A)\n",
      "    :param resistance: Resistance in ohms (Ω)\n",
      "    :return: Voltage drop in volts (V)\n",
      "    \"\"\"\n",
      "    return current * resistance\n",
      "```\n",
      "\n",
      "### Testing the Function\n",
      "\n",
      "Now, let's test the function with a current of 2A and resistance of 4Ω, and print the result:\n",
      "\n",
      "```python\n",
      "# Test the function\n",
      "current = 2  # in amperes\n",
      "resistance = 4  # in ohms\n",
      "\n",
      "# Calculate voltage drop\n",
      "result = voltage_drop(current, resistance)\n",
      "\n",
      "# Print the result\n",
      "print(f\"Voltage Drop: {result} V\")\n",
      "```\n",
      "\n",
      "### Function for Series Circuit\n",
      "\n",
      "In a series circuit, the voltage drop across each resistor can be calculated individually using the same `voltage_drop` function. You simply apply the function to each resistor in the series circuit using their respective current (which is the same for all resistors in a series circuit) and resistance values.\n",
      "\n",
      "Here's how you can calculate the voltage drop across each resistor in a series circuit:\n",
      "\n",
      "```python\n",
      "def voltage_drop_series(current, resistances):\n",
      "    \"\"\"\n",
      "    Calculate the voltage drop across each resistor in a series circuit.\n",
      "\n",
      "    :param current: Current in amperes (A)\n",
      "    :param resistances: List of resistances in ohms (Ω)\n",
      "    :return: List of voltage drops in volts (V) for each resistor\n",
      "    \"\"\"\n",
      "    return [voltage_drop(current, resistance) for resistance in resistances]\n",
      "\n",
      "# Example usage\n",
      "resistances = [4, 5, 6]  # List of resistances in ohms\n",
      "current = 2  # Current in amperes\n",
      "\n",
      "# Calculate voltage drops across each resistor\n",
      "voltage_drops = voltage_drop_series(current, resistances)\n",
      "\n",
      "# Print the results\n",
      "print(\"Voltage Drops in Series Circuit:\")\n",
      "for i, drop in enumerate(voltage_drops):\n",
      "    print(f\"Resistor {i+1}: {drop} V\")\n",
      "```\n",
      "\n",
      "This approach allows you to calculate the voltage drop across each resistor in a series circuit by iterating over the list of resistances.\n",
